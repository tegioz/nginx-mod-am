=============================

(Forked from https://bitbucket.org/hamano/nginx-mod-am)

#NOTE

The fix introduced in this fork (CDSSO post handling problem -> https://github.com/tegioz/nginx-mod-am/commit/3b1955534d2396a7ba8ae301dc8bb77782f017c0) has already been merged into the main module repository (as well as in the OpenAM incubator branch), so you should use it instead of this one.
